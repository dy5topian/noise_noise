this project done one 16/12/2023
the aim was ---> there was not really any aim just wanted to create something with p5js 
and here we are 
idea : i was thinking about creating some warms that travel across the canvas 
and i remembered about the idea that if a monkey keeps hitting a keyboard he will eventually be able to write a play by shakespeare
well then that's it my worms each with diffrent color will someday be able to draw the monalisa if the live eternally so just run this and wait for it .
yeah btw this is the first time i commit in github CLI it's kinda complicated but meeh ...
